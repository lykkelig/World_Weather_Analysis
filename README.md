# Module 19 - WeatherPy with Python API's

## Overview of Project
This was a fun project to randomly select a vacation spot based on minimum and maximum temperatures.

## Analysis Three Jupyter notebooks
* [Atomic:] Generate a random list of latitude and longitude and write to a CSV file.
* [Atomic:] Use the random list above to filter based on temperature criteria.
* [Atomic:] Select those locations which have hotels within the specified radius.

## Summary  End Result
* [Atomic:] There appears to be an issue with my Google API key, I am getting a message that it has expired and I need to add a new credit card number. I do not want to get charged for this so I completed the project with out the hotel data.
